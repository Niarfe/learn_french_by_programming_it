# learn_french_by_programming_it

## Scratch project to help me learn french language rules by actually programming them in python.
I expect this will get really complicated, and at some point I'll have to abandon the effort, 
but in the attempt I think it will make it easier to learn the grammer rules, and ...
also, there are some design techniques I want to apply, is object oriented best?
Or is a SDR approach better, flowchart funtional logic is better?  lots of questions
